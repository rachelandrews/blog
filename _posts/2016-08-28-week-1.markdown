## What did you do this past week?

This past week I downloaded and made myself familiar with all the necessary tools for the class. I also read the readings needed for the week after. 

## What's in your way?

I feel my confidence is in the way. I shy away from coding, since I feel I am not very good. I hope to break out of that with this class and show to myself I have what it takes to be in this field.

## What will you do next week?

Next week I will continue with more readings. Hopefully the first project will come out and I will be able to familiarize myself with the material.

## Experience

The class has been exciting so far. Professor Downing creates an environment of interation that I have not seen in many other computer science classes. By chance I was called on both days of class. Not only was I called, but the first person each time. For one question, I did not know the answer. However, Professor Downing still made me attempt the question until I got the right answer. I appreciated this because it shows how he does not let us off the hook for not knowing the answer but encourages us to continue until we get it right. I also enjoyed going line by line of the code to understand what it does. Often times I skim over the code which leads me to not fully understand its entirety. Now I am beginning a new habit of taking the time to comprehend what every line does.

I am excited for a class that is applicable to the industry. Many of our classes so far have been theory based or simple coding classes. However, this course captures how enterprise development is done. I find this a valuable asset, and I am excited to see what comes out of this experience.

## Tip-of-the-week

From reading previous articles, brushing up on C would be beneficial.
